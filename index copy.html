                    <h2><span class="primary-text"> by Shreyasi, 2nd year Grad student, ATLAS</span></h2>
                    <p class="lead">The term "Exodus" became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic which means there is an alleged mass emigration of residents from California to other U.S. states and countries. 
                        The cause and existence of this migration has been extensively debated.

                        Officials blamed the decrease on declining birth rates, higher deaths from the pandemic and fewer people moving into the state from elsewhere in the US. <strong><span>California lost 117,552 people in 2021</span></strong>, putting its population at 39,185,605". quoted by California department of finance.</cite></p>

                <h2> <span class="m-text">Current</span> Scenario </h2>
                <p>Lower levels of international migration, declining birth rates, and increases in deaths all play a role. But the primary driver of the state’s population loss over the past couple years has been the result of California residents moving to other states. It is a remarkable turnaround for California—long the epicenter of population growth in the United States. Even so, it is a continuation of a decades-long slow down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong> Since 2010, about 7.5 million people moved from California to other states, while only 5.8 million people moved to California from other parts of the country. According to Department of Finance estimates, the state has lost residents to other states every year since 2001.</strong>
<br>
<br>
The highest-income Californians pay the largest share of the state’s personal income tax. For the 2019 tax year, the top 1 percent of income earners paid almost 45 percent of all personal income taxes. This percentage has been greater than 40 percent in every year since 2004, except for 2009. 
Fact is that California has been losing lower- and middle-income residents to other states for some time while continuing to gain higher-income adults. In the past five years the flow of middle-income residents out of the state has accelerated and net gains among higher income adults have ceased. Therefore a small change in the population consequently, can have a positive or negative changes in the income of a relatively small group of taxpayers that can have a significant impact on state revenues.

                    On average, electricity users in California spend about $216 per month on electricity. That adds up to $2,592 per year. That’s 28% higher than the national average electric bill of $2,029.
                    The most significant reason for the high cost of living in the area is due to its proximity to Silicon Valley and the high rates of pay for jobs in the region offer.

            <p>The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Diego is about $2,887 per month, which is a 15 percent increase in cost over last year. 
                A two-bedroom is around $3,774 per month on average, a 18 percent increase over last year.It fluctuates, depending on sales, property and county tax. The biggest reason for costly Cost of living is because of<strong> HIGH SALES TAX, which is the highest in the nation.</strong>
            <br>
    
            Miscellaneous costs refer to a wide range of goods and services including things like common restaurant foods, clothing, entertainment, activities and personal care. In California, the cost of these goods and services range all the way from below 11% to above 33% of the national average!
            In San Diego County, miscellaneous costs match the average of most California cities and rank 10% higher than the rest of the country. 
            <br><cite>Style comes with a price in the San Diego.</cite>A haircut will cost you an average of 23% more compared to the rest of the country and your rad new shirt will be 36% more. But hey, you can order pizza for only about 5% more than the typical U.S. city in San Diego County—and there’s Disneyland in Los Angeles, near to San Diego.
